# COLOR GRADING, COLOR CORRECTION & CINEMATOGRAPHY COLOR ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK FOR PROOF

## Part 1: The Color Canon — Films, Colorists, DPs & Why They Matter

These are the defining references for color in cinema. Each one teaches your AI what exceptional color looks like and why it works.

### Warm & Golden Palette

- **The Godfather** (DP Gordon Willis, no credited colorist at the time) — the gold and amber palette that defined an era. Shadows are rich and deep, highlights are warm, skin tones glow. Gordon Willis was called "The Prince of Darkness" because he wasn't afraid to let faces fall into shadow. This film taught Hollywood that underexposure is a creative choice, not a mistake.

- **Blade Runner 2049** (DP Roger Deakins, colorist Jill Bogdanowicz) — warm amber and orange juxtaposed against cold steel blue. Every environment has its own color identity. The Las Vegas sequence is one of the greatest uses of monochromatic warm grading ever put on screen — everything bathed in deep orange haze.

- **Dune** (DP Greig Fraser, colorist Dave Cole) — desert gold, warm earth tones, desaturated but never flat. The Arrakis sequences use a restricted warm palette that makes the blue of the Fremen eyes pop. The contrast between Caladan's cool, muted tones and Arrakis's baked warmth tells you where you are before a single word of dialogue.

- **Amelie** (DP Bruno Delbonnel, color graded in DI by Duboi) — stylized warm greens and reds. One of the first films to use digital intermediate color grading to create a fantasy version of reality. Every frame looks like a painting. The warmth makes Paris feel like a fairy tale.

### Cool & Desaturated Palette

- **Se7en** (DP Darius Khondji, bleach bypass process) — the film that made dark, desaturated, greenish grading a genre unto itself. The bleach bypass process retained silver in the print, crushing blacks and desaturating color while adding grain and contrast. Sickly greens, muted skin, deep impenetrable shadows.

- **Zodiac** (DP Harris Savides, colorist Stephen Nakamura) — cool, sterile, institutional color. The grade feels clinical, like fluorescent office lighting. It makes 1970s San Francisco feel oppressive and paranoid. The color tells you this story is about obsession eating away at people under harsh light.

- **The Matrix** (DP Bill Pope, colorist at the time unnamed) — the iconic green tint for scenes inside the Matrix versus warmer, bluer tones for the real world. This was one of the first mainstream uses of color grading as a narrative device — color literally tells you which reality you're in.

- **Prisoners** (DP Roger Deakins, colorist Jill Bogdanowicz) — cold, overcast, desaturated Northeastern fall. Muted yellows and greys. The palette feels like the sky is pressing down on you. Deakins and Bogdanowicz stripped the warmth out of what could have been beautiful autumn foliage and made it feel threatening.

### High Contrast & Bold Color

- **Mad Max Fury Road** (DP John Seale, colorist Eric Whipp) — teal and orange pushed to the extreme. The daytime desert is searing orange. The night scenes are deep blue. Skin tones are saturated and warm against cool shadows. This film proves that bold, aggressive color grading can serve a story when the story is bold and aggressive.

- **La La Land** (DP Linus Sandgren, colorist Natasha Leonnet) — rich, saturated primary colors. The famous blue and purple twilight of the Griffith Observatory scene. Red dresses, blue suits, golden hour magic hour. The color is romantic and nostalgic, deliberately evoking classic Hollywood Technicolor musicals. Natasha Leonnet at Company 3 is one of the industry's top colorists.

- **The Grand Budapest Hotel** (DP Robert Yeoman, colorist Jill Bogdanowicz) — Wes Anderson's most color-controlled film. Pink, purple, lavender, and warm pastels in the hotel sequences. Muted, desaturated earth tones in the war sequences. Each timeline has its own color identity. The palette is the narrative.

### Natural & Filmic

- **The Revenant** (DP Emmanuel Lubezki) — shot almost entirely in natural light. The color feels raw, cold, and unmanipulated. Blues and greys dominate. Skin tones are pale and weathered. This is what "natural" grade looks like when it's done by a master — it's not flat, it's restrained. Every bit of color that exists in the frame earned its way there.

- **Nomadland** (DP Joshua James Richards, colorist Mike Hatzer) — golden hour magic hour photography with a naturalistic grade. Warm but not pushed. The American West in honest, beautiful, unsentimental color. The grade feels like you're seeing reality through slightly more poetic eyes.

- **Tree of Life** (DP Emmanuel Lubezki, colorist Skip Kimball) — natural light pushed to its spiritual limit. Golden backlight, lens flares embraced not avoided, warm amber tones in memory sequences. The color feels like nostalgia itself.

- **Moonlight** (DP James Laxton, colorist Alex Bickel) — rich, deep skin tones on dark skin treated with the care and beauty they deserve. Teal moonlight against warm interior gold. This film is a masterclass in lighting and grading for darker complexions, something the industry historically got wrong. The color is lush and sensual without being overdone.

### Stylized & Experimental

- **Neon Demon** (DP Natasha Braier, colorist Matt Wallach) — extreme neon reds, blues, and magentas. Fashion world as a horror palette. This film uses color as a weapon — it's designed to make you uncomfortable through sheer saturation and contrast.

- **Only Lovers Left Alive** (DP Yorick Le Saux, colorist Yvan Lucas) — deep, rich, velvety darks. Jewel tones — emerald, ruby, sapphire — in a desaturated world. The color palette feels ancient and luxurious.

- **In the Mood for Love** (DP Christopher Doyle, no DI — achieved through lighting and film stock) — deep reds, greens, and warm amber. Every frame looks like it's lit by candlelight reflected off silk. The color isn't graded in post — it's created in camera through lighting, set design, and film stock choice. This is the reminder that great color starts on set, not in the suite.

- **Joker** (DP Lawrence Sher, colorist Jill Bogdanowicz) — desaturated, gritty early 1980s palette that gradually introduces more color as Arthur transforms. Faded greens, dirty yellows, and institutional fluorescence give way to bold reds and warmer tones. The color grade literally tracks the character's psychological transformation.

### Colorists Your AI Should Study as References

- **Jill Bogdanowicz** (Company 3) — Blade Runner 2049, Prisoners, The Grand Budapest Hotel, Joker, Dune Part Two. One of the most prolific and versatile colorists working today. Her work ranges from extreme stylization to naturalistic beauty.

- **Stefan Sonnenfeld** (Company 3) — Transformers series, 300, A Star is Born, Top Gun Maverick. Known for bold, commercial, high-impact color.

- **Tom Poole** (Company 3) — Moonlight, If Beale Street Could Talk, Queen and Slim. Exceptional with skin tones, particularly on darker complexions. His work is lush and emotionally resonant.

- **Natasha Leonnet** (Company 3) — La La Land, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, First Man. Warm, emotionally evocative grading that serves character and nostalgia.

- **Joe Walker** (not the editor — the colorist at Goldcrest) — known for naturalistic high-end work.

- **Asa Fox** (The Mill) — commercial colorist whose work bridges advertising and narrative. Important reference for the Proof brand and commercial video space.

- **Stephen Nakamura** (Company 3) — Zodiac, Gone Girl, Mank. Fincher's go-to colorist. Precision, control, and a cold clinical beauty that defines modern thriller grading.

### DPs Whose Color Philosophy Your AI Should Understand

- **Roger Deakins** — motivated, naturalistic light with deep understanding of color contrast. His work looks effortless but every color choice is deliberate.

- **Emmanuel Lubezki** — natural light evangelist. Three consecutive Best Cinematography Oscars for Gravity, Birdman, and The Revenant. His color comes from the world, not the suite.

- **Hoyte van Hoytema** — Interstellar, Dunkirk, Oppenheimer. Warm, high contrast, filmic color. Shoots on large format film whenever possible. His color feels physical and tactile.

- **Bradford Young** — Selma, Arrival, Solo. Rich, atmospheric, slightly underexposed with deep shadow work. His color palette tends toward naturalism with an emotional undercurrent.

- **Janusz Kaminski** — Spielberg's DP since Schindler's List. Known for blown-out highlights, hazy atmosphere, and desaturated-yet-warm palettes. His "Spielberg look" is defined by controlled overexposure and selective color.

## Part 2: Color Science Fundamentals — What the AI Must Understand

Before the AI can critique color, it needs to understand the science and language of color in imaging.

### Color Temperature (measured in Kelvin)

| Light Source | Temperature | Quality |
|--------------|-------------|---------|
| Candlelight | ~1800-2000K | Very warm orange |
| Tungsten/incandescent bulbs | ~2700-3200K | Warm yellowish |
| Halogen | ~3000-3500K | Neutral warm |
| Daylight (noon sun) | ~5500-6000K | Neutral white |
| Overcast sky | ~6500-7500K | Cool blue-white |
| Shade | ~7000-8000K | Cool blue |
| Blue sky | ~10000-15000K | Very cool blue |

When white balance is set correctly, white objects appear white. When it's wrong, the entire image shifts warm or cool. Mixed color temperatures within a frame (daylight through windows plus tungsten interior lights) create competing warm and cool zones that must be managed intentionally.

### Color Space & Gamut

- **Rec. 709** — the standard color space for HD video
- **sRGB** — the equivalent for web display
- **Rec. 2020** — the wide color gamut standard for HDR and 4K/UHD delivery
- **DCI-P3** — the cinema projection standard (wider than Rec. 709 but narrower than Rec. 2020)
- **Log and RAW color spaces** (S-Log, C-Log, V-Log, BRAW, ProRes RAW) — capture formats designed to preserve maximum dynamic range and color information for grading. They look flat and desaturated straight out of camera and require grading to look correct.

The AI should be able to identify whether footage appears to be ungraded log footage and flag it.

### Dynamic Range & Exposure

- **Dynamic range** — the difference between the darkest and brightest values an image can hold detail in, measured in stops
- Consumer cameras typically capture **10-12 stops**
- Cinema cameras capture **13-16+ stops**
- HDR delivery can display up to **1000-4000 nits** of brightness versus SDR's 100 nits
- Proper exposure places skin tones around **55-70 IRE** on a waveform monitor
- **Overexposure** clips highlights to pure white, losing detail permanently
- **Underexposure** crushes shadows to pure black
- Both are acceptable as intentional creative choices but should be flagged as technical errors when unintentional

### The Vectorscope & Skin Tone Line

A vectorscope displays color information in a circular graph. There is a specific line on the vectorscope between the red and yellow targets called the **skin tone line** or the **I-line**.

Regardless of ethnicity, all human skin tones fall along this line when properly white balanced:
- Lighter skin sits closer to the center (less saturated)
- Darker skin sits further from center (more saturated)
- Both fall on the same angle

If skin tones deviate from this line, something is wrong — green tint pushes toward green, too much magenta pushes the other way. The AI should analyze skin tones in any frame containing people and flag deviations from the skin tone line.

### Waveform Analysis

The waveform monitor shows luminance (brightness) values from 0 (pure black) at the bottom to 100 IRE (pure white) at the top.

- A well-exposed image typically has information spread across the full range without clipping at 0 or 100
- **Crushed blacks** (large clusters at 0) mean shadow detail is lost
- **Blown highlights** (large clusters at 100) mean highlight detail is lost
- A **flat or low-contrast** image shows a narrow band of information clustered in the middle
- A **high-contrast** image shows information spread wide with gaps between highlights and shadows

## Part 3: Color Correction vs. Color Grading — The AI Must Distinguish

These are two different processes and the AI needs to evaluate both.

### Color Correction (Primary Correction)

This is the technical foundation. It's about making the image look **correct** before making it look stylized.

The AI should check for:
- **Correct white balance** — whites should be neutral unless intentionally shifted
- **Consistent exposure** between shots in the same scene
- **Proper black levels** — shadows should have detail unless crushed intentionally
- **Proper highlight levels** — highlights should have detail unless blown intentionally
- **Shot matching** — consecutive shots in the same scene should have matching exposure, white balance, and contrast
- **Skin tone accuracy** — skin should fall on the vectorscope skin tone line
- **Removal of color casts** — unintentional green, magenta, cyan, or yellow casts from mixed lighting or incorrect white balance

The AI should evaluate all of these as pass/fail technical criteria.

### Color Grading (Secondary & Creative)

This is the artistic layer that happens after correction. It's about creating a mood, a feeling, and a visual identity.

The AI should evaluate:
- Whether a **deliberate creative grade** has been applied or whether the footage looks default or straight-out-of-camera
- Whether the grade is **consistent** across the entire piece
- Whether the grade **serves the mood and content**:
  - Warm and inviting for family homes
  - Cool and sleek for modern architecture
  - Rich and luxurious for high-end estates
  - Bright and airy for coastal properties
  - Moody and dramatic for brand films
- Whether the grade uses any recognizable **palette strategy**:
  - Complementary colors (teal/orange)
  - Analogous colors (warm spectrum)
  - Monochromatic
  - Triadic
- Whether the grade **enhances or fights** the natural lighting of the scene

## Part 4: The Cinematic Look — What Makes an Image Feel Like a Movie

This is the specific criteria your AI should use when evaluating how "cinematic" an image or video feels. The cinematic look is a combination of many factors working together.

### Contrast

Cinematic images typically have a strong but controlled contrast ratio:
- Deep, rich shadows that aren't crushed to pure black — there's still detail and texture in the dark areas
- Highlights that roll off smoothly rather than clipping abruptly

The difference between cinema and amateur video is often that cinema has **controlled contrast** (shadows have color and detail) while amateur video has either **flat contrast** (everything looks grey and lifeless) or **harsh contrast** (shadows are pure black, highlights are pure white, with nothing in between).

The AI should:
- Measure contrast ratio
- Flag images that are **too flat** (low contrast, typically from ungraded log footage)
- Flag images that are **too harsh** (excessive contrast with lost detail on both ends)
- Ideal cinematic contrast places the darkest shadow detail around **5-10 IRE** and the brightest highlight detail around **90-95 IRE**, with a smooth rolloff curve between them

### Lift, Gamma, Gain (Shadows, Midtones, Highlights)

Cinematic color grading typically involves subtle color shifts in the shadows, midtones, and highlights independently.

Common cinematic techniques:
- **Warm highlights with cool shadows** (golden skin tones against blue-tinted shadow areas)
- **Uniform desaturation** with a single accent color left saturated
- **Complementary color split** — teal in the shadows, orange in the highlights (the most ubiquitous modern cinematic look)

The AI should identify what color relationships exist between the shadow, midtone, and highlight regions and evaluate whether they're intentional and effective.

### Saturation

Cinematic images are almost never fully saturated. The most common approaches:
- **Global desaturation** of 10-30% from "reality" with selective re-saturation of key elements (skin, accent colors, practical lights)
- **Saturation pushed in specific hue ranges** while pulled in others (e.g., warm tones saturated while cool tones desaturated)

**Oversaturation is one of the most common amateur mistakes.** When everything is vivid, nothing stands out.

The AI should flag:
- Images where saturation exceeds natural levels globally
- Skin tones that are oversaturated (especially orange or red)
- Saturation levels that don't match the intended mood

### Black Level & Shadow Quality

Where the blacks sit defines the mood more than almost any other single parameter.

| Black Level Style | Description | Use Case |
|-------------------|-------------|----------|
| **Lifted blacks** | Shadows don't reach pure black, sit at dark grey | Faded, vintage, matte look. Common in indie films, music videos, Instagram aesthetics |
| **True blacks** | Shadows reach 0 IRE but not crushing | Rich, contrasty, modern cinematic look. Standard for most high-end production |
| **Crushed blacks** | Large areas of pure black with no detail | Harsh, dramatic, high-contrast look. Used intentionally in noir and thriller genres |

The AI should identify which approach is being used and whether it's consistent and intentional.

### Highlight Rolloff

How highlights transition from bright to clipped defines the "feel" of the image.

- **Film (and high-end cinema cameras)** has a gentle, organic highlight rolloff — bright areas gradually lose saturation and transition to white smoothly
- **Cheaper cameras and video** have a hard highlight clip — bright areas abruptly hit pure white with an ugly, digital-looking edge

The AI should flag images with harsh highlight clipping, especially on windows, skies, and reflective surfaces. In real estate specifically, **blown-out windows are one of the most common issues** — the AI should note whether window highlights have been managed through HDR blending, exposure bracketing, or flash fill.

### Color Palette Restriction

Cinematic images rarely contain the full rainbow. Great colorists restrict the palette to a defined set of colors and push everything else toward those anchors.

- A warm film might live entirely in the amber, gold, brown, and cream range
- A cold film might restrict to blue, steel, grey, and desaturated green

**The power comes from restriction** — when you limit the palette, the colors that remain become more powerful.

The AI should:
- Analyze the dominant color palette of each piece
- Flag inconsistencies where colors outside the established palette appear without apparent intention
- Flag work that has **no discernible palette strategy** — meaning it looks like ungraded default footage

### Grain & Texture

Film grain (or carefully applied digital grain) adds organic texture that makes images feel less sterile and more cinematic.

- **Fine grain** suggests modern film stocks or clean digital
- **Heavy grain** suggests vintage stocks, low light, or intentional stylization
- **No grain at all** (perfectly clean digital) can feel sterile and video-like, particularly in narrative and brand work

The AI should note the presence or absence of grain and whether it serves the aesthetic:
- For **real estate**, grain should be minimal to absent
- For **brand films and commercials**, subtle grain can add warmth and production value

### Depth of Field & Bokeh

While not strictly a color parameter, depth of field dramatically affects the look.

- **Shallow depth of field** (blurry backgrounds) is a hallmark of the cinematic look because it directs attention and creates separation between subject and background
- The quality of the out-of-focus areas (**bokeh**) matters:
  - Smooth, creamy bokeh with circular or slightly oval highlights reads as cinematic
  - Busy, nervous bokeh with hard edges reads as amateur

The AI should note depth of field choices and whether they serve the composition and subject.

## Part 5: Color Analysis Metrics — What Proof Should Evaluate

### Metric 1: White Balance Accuracy

Is the white balance set correctly? Are whites neutral? Are there unintentional color casts?

The AI should analyze areas that should be neutral (white walls, grey surfaces, white ceilings) and measure their deviation from true neutral. **Flag deviations greater than ±200K** from the target color temperature unless the shift is clearly intentional and consistent.

### Metric 2: Exposure Consistency

Are consecutive shots in the same space similarly exposed?

The AI should measure average luminance per shot and **flag variations greater than 0.5 stops** between cuts within the same scene. Transitions between spaces can have different exposures (interior to exterior for example) but shots within the same room should match.

### Metric 3: Skin Tone Accuracy

When people are in frame (agent on camera, testimonials, brand videos), are skin tones accurate and flattering?

The AI should check skin tones against the vectorscope skin tone line. Flag:
- Green, magenta, or overly orange skin
- Skin desaturated to the point of looking grey or unhealthy
- Skin oversaturated to the point of looking sunburned or artificial

### Metric 4: Contrast Ratio

Is the contrast appropriate for the content type and mood?

The AI should measure the difference between the 10th percentile shadow value and the 90th percentile highlight value. Flag:
- Images that are **too flat** (contrast ratio less than 40 IRE spread — typical of ungraded log footage)
- Images that are **too harsh** (contrast ratio with significant clipping on both ends)

### Metric 5: Saturation Levels

Is the saturation appropriate?

The AI should measure average saturation and peak saturation across the frame. Flag:
- **Global oversaturation** (average saturation above 60% of maximum)
- **Oversaturated skin tones** specifically
- **Completely desaturated images** that may be unintentionally flat

### Metric 6: Black Level Consistency

Where do the blacks sit, and is it consistent?

The AI should measure the minimum luminance value in each shot and **flag inconsistencies greater than 5 IRE** between shots in the same sequence. Lifted blacks in one shot and crushed blacks in the next indicates inconsistent grading.

### Metric 7: Highlight Management

Are highlights controlled?

The AI should identify areas of pure white clipping and measure what percentage of the frame is at 100 IRE. In real estate specifically, flag:
- Blown-out windows (the most common issue)
- Blown-out sky
- Blown-out reflective surfaces
- Any frame with **more than 5% of pixels at pure white** in non-sky areas

### Metric 8: Color Palette Cohesion

Does the piece have a consistent color palette?

The AI should extract the dominant colors from each shot and compare them across the timeline. Flag:
- Shots where the color palette shifts dramatically without a narrative reason
- Identify whether a deliberate palette strategy exists and name it:
  - Warm tonal
  - Cool tonal
  - Complementary teal-orange
  - Analogous warm
  - Monochromatic
  - etc.

### Metric 9: Grade Application

Has a color grade been applied at all?

The AI should distinguish between graded footage and default or ungraded footage:
- **Log footage that hasn't been converted** through a LUT or manual grade is an immediate critical flag
- **Rec. 709 footage that looks straight-out-of-camera** with no creative grade should be flagged as a suggestion for improvement

### Metric 10: Shot Matching

Do consecutive shots in the same scene match in color, exposure, and contrast?

This is one of the most important technical checks. The AI should compare side-by-side:
- Color values
- Luminance histograms
- Overall tone

Between every pair of consecutive shots and flag mismatches. Even beautifully graded individual shots fail if they don't match each other in a sequence.

## Part 6: Content-Type-Specific Color Guidelines

### Luxury Real Estate

- Warm, rich tones with deep shadows
- Gold, amber, cream, and dark wood tones should be emphasized
- Whites should be clean but not sterile — slightly warm
- Exterior shots should maximize blue sky and green landscaping contrast against warm architectural tones
- Evening/twilight shots should have deep blue sky with warm interior glow from windows
- Contrast should be moderate to high
- Saturation should be moderate — rich but not cartoonish
- **Reference feel:** Blade Runner 2049's interiors or a high-end hotel commercial

### Modern / Contemporary Homes

- Clean, bright, slightly cool
- Whites should be crisp and true
- Colors should be accurate and saturated without being overdone
- The grade should emphasize clean lines and surfaces
- Contrast should be moderate
- Shadows should be open and detailed
- **Reference feel:** Apple product video — minimal, precise, and clean

### Family / Starter Homes

- Warm, inviting, bright
- Slightly lifted shadows to create an approachable, friendly feel
- Saturated greens in landscaping, warm skin tones on people
- The grade should make the home feel livable and welcoming, not aspirational to the point of intimidation
- **Reference feel:** Nancy Meyers film interior — warm, bright, idealized but believable

### Brand Videos

- Grade should match the brand's visual identity
- If the brand is bold and energetic, the color should be saturated and contrasty
- If the brand is premium and understated, the color should be desaturated and refined
- The most important thing is **consistency with existing brand materials and guidelines**
- Reference the brand's color palette and ensure the grade harmonizes

### Testimonials

- **Skin tones are the priority**
- Warm, flattering light with accurate skin color
- Background should be slightly desaturated relative to the subject to create visual separation
- Contrast should be moderate — not flat (looks unprofessional) and not harsh (unflattering on faces)
- **Reference feel:** Well-lit interview in a documentary — think Won't You Be My Neighbor or The Last Dance interview segments

### Drone / Aerial

- Sky color and exposure management are critical
- Blue skies should be rich without being oversaturated
- Green landscapes should be vibrant without being neon
- Haze and atmospheric perspective (distant objects being lighter and bluer) can be either embraced for mood or corrected for clarity depending on intent
- Golden hour drone footage should lean into the warmth
- Midday drone should maintain neutral-to-warm balance
- Flag drone shots where:
  - The sky is blown out
  - The landscape is flat and hazy without intention
  - The color doesn't match the ground-level shots in the same video

### Twilight / Blue Hour Exteriors

This is the hero shot for luxury real estate.

- Deep blue sky (not black, not light — that specific cobalt twilight blue)
- Warm golden interior light glowing from every window
- The contrast between warm interiors and cool sky is what makes these shots magical

Flag twilight shots where:
- The sky has gone too dark (missed the window)
- The interiors are too dim (lights not turned on)
- The balance between warm and cool isn't right
- The exposure brackets weren't blended properly

## Part 7: The Feedback Output Format for Color

When Proof delivers color analysis, the feedback should include:

### Overall Color Score
A grade representing the total color and grading quality.

### Technical Pass/Fail
- White balance
- Exposure consistency
- Skin tones
- Highlight clipping
- Black levels

These are objective and measurable.

### Creative Evaluation
- Palette cohesion
- Grade intention
- Mood appropriateness
- Cinematic quality

These are subjective but informed by the canon of references above.

### Specific Callouts with Frame References

Examples:
- "Frame at 0:23 has a color temperature shift of approximately 800K cooler than the preceding shot. Match the white balance to maintain continuity."
- "Highlights on the kitchen window are clipped at 100 IRE across 12% of the frame. Consider an HDR blend or graduated filter to recover detail."

### Before/After Suggestions

Where possible, describe what the correction would look like:
- "Warming the shadows by 10-15 units on the orange vector and lifting the blacks to approximately 8 IRE would give this sequence a more polished, cinematic warmth consistent with the luxury property type."

### Reference Film or Look

When a grade is close to a known cinematic reference, call it out:
- "The current grade has a cool, desaturated quality similar to Zodiac. If the intent is luxury warmth, consider shifting toward a Blade Runner 2049 amber palette in the highlights while maintaining the cool shadow tone."

This gives the editor a concrete visual reference to work toward.
